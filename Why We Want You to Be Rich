📘 Why We Want You to Be Rich — Robert T. Kiyosaki & Donald J. Trump
🔹 1500-Word Informative Summary

Why We Want You to Be Rich is a motivational and strategic guide focused on financial education, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. The book argues that in today’s world, being financially smart is no longer optional—it is a necessity for survival and freedom.

Kiyosaki and Trump explain that governments, companies, and pension systems are becoming unreliable. Jobs are insecure, taxes are rising, and inflation is reducing the value of money. In such an environment, only financially educated people can protect themselves.

The authors say they “want you to be rich” not for ego, but because rich people:

Think differently

Create jobs

Build businesses

Control their future

Have choices

The Problem with Traditional Education

Schools teach people how to:

Get good grades

Get a job

Earn a salary

But they don’t teach:

How money works

How to invest

How to build assets

How to create businesses

This creates a society where most people:

Depend on salaries

Live paycheck to paycheck

Struggle with debt

Fear financial risk

The Rich vs The Poor Mindset

The book compares two mindsets:

Poor / Middle-Class Mindset:

“I need job security”

“Investing is risky”

“I’ll save money”

“I’ll work hard for money”

Rich Mindset:

“I create opportunities”

“Knowledge reduces risk”

“I invest in assets”

“Money works for me”

Rich people don’t avoid risk—they manage it using education.

Financial Education = Power

The authors stress that financial education is more powerful than money. Even if someone becomes rich suddenly (lottery, inheritance), they often lose it without proper knowledge.

Financial education includes:

Understanding cash flow

Knowing assets vs liabilities

Learning investing

Managing taxes

Building businesses

Entrepreneurs Create Wealth

Jobs don’t create wealth—businesses do.

Entrepreneurs:

Solve problems

Create products

Build systems

Employ people

Generate scalable income

The book encourages people to move from:
Employee → Business Owner → Investor

Passive Income is the Goal

True freedom comes from passive income, such as:

Rental income

Business profits

Royalties

Dividends

When passive income > expenses, you achieve financial freedom.

Why the Rich Get Richer

The rich:

Invest in assets

Use leverage wisely

Security
