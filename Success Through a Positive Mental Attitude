📘 Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude

— Napoleon Hill & W. Clement Stone

🔹 1500-Word Informative Summary

Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) explains that success in any area of life—money, career, health, relationships—depends more on mindset than on talent, education, or luck. Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone combine philosophy, psychology, and real-life success stories to show how thoughts shape outcomes.

The central idea of the book is PMA (Positive Mental Attitude)—a mental state that allows a person to face challenges with faith, optimism, confidence, and persistence. According to the authors, people with PMA look for solutions, while people with NMA (Negative Mental Attitude) look for excuses.

What Is Positive Mental Attitude (PMA)?

PMA is not blind optimism. It is a disciplined way of thinking that combines:

Faith

Hope

Confidence

Constructive thinking

Persistence

A person with PMA:

Believes problems can be solved

Accepts responsibility

Learns from failure

Keeps moving forward

A person with NMA:

Complains

Blames others

Fears failure

Quits easily

Thoughts Shape Reality

The book strongly supports the idea that thoughts influence actions, actions create habits, and habits determine destiny. If you constantly think negatively, you unconsciously act in ways that confirm failure. If you think positively, you take action even in uncertainty.

The authors emphasize:

You don’t attract what you want — you attract what you think.

Faith vs Fear

Faith is described as the antidote to fear. Fear blocks creativity, decision-making, and opportunity recognition. Successful people are not fearless, but they act despite fear.

The book teaches that faith:

Strengthens confidence

Improves decision-making

Increases resilience

Encourages action

Fear:

Paralyzes action

Weakens belief

Creates procrastination

Definite Purpose

A recurring theme (from Think and Grow Rich) is having a definite purpose in life. People who succeed know:

What they want

Why they want it

What they are willing to give in return

Without a clear purpose, even positive thinking becomes directionless.

Persistence: The Key Difference

Most people fail not because they lack ability, but because they quit too soon. The book explains that success often arrives just after the moment when most people give up.

PMA fuels persistence by:

Keeping hope alive

Turning failures into lessons

Maintaining effort during setbacks

Success Leaves Clues

The authors studied thousands of successful individuals and found common traits:

Self-belief

Discipline

Goal clarity

Service mindset

Positive attitude

Failure leaves clues too:

Negative thinking

Excuses

Fear of criticism

Indecision

Service and Value Creation

The book teaches that success is tied to service. Money and recognition come when you solve problems and add value to others’ lives. People with PMA focus on contribution rather than entitlement.

Environment and Association

You become like the people you associate with. Negative people weaken PMA, while positive thinkers reinforce it. The book advises consciously choosing:

Positive environments

Growth-focused people

Encouraging influences

Handling Failure

Failure is not the opposite of success—it is part of it. People with PMA:

Learn from mistakes

Adjust strategy

Keep belief intact

People with NMA:

Take failure personally

Lose confidence

Quit

The Core Message

Success is not a matter of chance.
It is a state of mind backed by action.

With PMA:

Problems become opportunities

Setbacks become lessons

Goals become achievable
