📘 30 Days to Better English — Norman Lewis
(Tricks & Techniques added to your existing reading framework)
🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY OF THE BOOK

This book improves English through daily structured practice, not heavy grammar rules.
The focus is on:

Word power

Sentence patterns

Habit-based learning

Thinking directly in English

🔧 TRICKS & TECHNIQUES FROM THE BOOK (ACTIONABLE)
1️⃣ ROOT-WORD TECHNIQUE (Vocabulary Multiplier)

Learn words using roots, prefixes, suffixes instead of memorizing lists.

Examples:

Port = carry → transport, portable, import

Dict = say → dictate, predict, verdict

🔹 Why it works:
One root gives you 10–15 words instantly.

🔹 Daily trick:
Learn 2 roots/day = 300+ words in a month

2️⃣ SENTENCE-CONSTRUCTION METHOD

Instead of grammar rules, practice fixed sentence patterns.

Pattern:

Subject + Verb + Object

Examples:

I read books.

I improve my English.

I practice daily.

🔹 Technique:
Create 5 new sentences/day using the same pattern.

3️⃣ VERB-CONTROL TECHNIQUE

English fluency depends on verb clarity, not vocabulary size.

Practice 1 verb in 3 tenses:

I speak English.

I spoke English.

I will speak English.

🔹 Daily habit:
1 verb × 5 sentences = fluency growth

4️⃣ THINK-IN-ENGLISH METHOD

Stop translating from your mother tongue.

Exercise:

Name objects → chair, phone, window

Describe actions → I am reading, I am walking

🔹 This builds automatic English thinking, which is the real goal.

5️⃣ LOUD READING TECHNIQUE

Silent reading doesn’t improve speaking.

Rule:

Read 10 minutes aloud daily

Focus on clear pronunciation, not speed

Improves:
✔ Pronunciation
✔ Confidence
✔ Sentence flow

6️⃣ CONTEXT-BASED LEARNING

Never learn a word alone.

Bad ❌

Abundant = plenty

Good ✅

“India has abundant natural resources.”

🔹 Technique:
Every new word → 1 spoken sentence

7️⃣ ASSOCIATION & IMAGERY TRICK

Link words to images or situations.

Example:

Brilliant → bright light → smart person

🔹 Brain remembers images faster than meanings.

8️⃣ REVISION CYCLE (MOST IMPORTANT)

Without revision, improvement stops.

Book-style revision:

Day 1 – Learn

Day 3 – Revise

Day 7 – Revise

Day 30 – Revise

Locks English into long-term memory.

9️⃣ ERROR-CORRECTION TECHNIQUE

Avoid direct translation mistakes.

Wrong ❌

I am having a pen

Correct ✅

I have a pen

🔹 Learn English expressions, not translated sentences.

🔟 SHORT-SENTENCE RULE

Clarity beats complexity.

Instead of:

“I would like to convey my appreciation…”

Say:

“Thank you.”
